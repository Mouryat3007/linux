Linux permission 

-------------------------------------------------------------
To execute a binary file

./<filename>

List long
  > ls -l 

-rw-rw-r--  when there is a hypen "-" in the start it represents file

drwxrwxr-x when you see d in the start it represents directory

rwx= read write execute



r w x      r w x      r w x
_ _ _      _ _ _      _ _ _

OWNER      GROUP      OTHERS

to add user
   > sudo useradd <username>

   useradd= to add user

TO add a group
   > sudo groupadd <group name>

   groupadd= to add new group

TO add users to the group
   > sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>

   -aG= add group

To change group of a file
   > sudo chgrp < newgroupname> <filename> 

   chgrp= change group

u= owner
g= group
o= others 

to give execute permission to owner for a particluar file
   > chmod u+x <filename>

to give execute permission to a group for a particluar file
   > chmod g+x <filename>

to give execute permission to both owner and group
   > chmod ug+x <filename>

to give execute permission to others
   > chmod o+x <filename>   


The process of using the above way to change permission is known as symbolic way where you use symbols usch as u , g, and o
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
The another way is know as absolute way where we use numbers

Read 'r'= 4

Write 'w'= 2

Execute 'x'= 1 

No permisssion = 0



-rw-rw-r--

in this way rw is 2 rw is 2 and r is 4

chmod 777 <filename>

output=rwxrwxrwx

r w x  r w x  r w x 
4 2 1  4 2 1  4 2 1

  7      7      7
